 *
 * This is a contact pulled from the phone. We may or may already
 * have them in our conversations. The point of this class is to
 * have all of our phones contacts stored on the client side
 * so that we can start a conversation (without having to enter in the exact number)
 * with anyone. The phone will parse it's contacts and send this class
 * which contains an arraylist full of Contact cards.
